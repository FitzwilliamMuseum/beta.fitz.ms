<p>Please <a href="https://tickets.museums.cam.ac.uk/events">book a free, timed ticket in advance</a>. Do your best to arrive on time (or preferably 5 minutes early) as we are operating timed ticketing. When you book a ticket, we will need your contact details so that we can let you know if we need to close the Collection at short notice, or if it is otherwise necessary to contact you about your visit eg. for Track and Trace purposes.</p>
<p>If you would like to borrow a Museum wheelchair, please also reserve this when you book your ticket.</p>
<p>We will be reopening our exhibition <em>Feast &amp; Fast</em> until 31 August, and you will need to book tickets for an accompanied visit in groups of no more than 6 visitors.</p>
<p>Visitors will be able to follow floor markings to help them move around the collection, and we are asking visitors to keep left and move in a clockwise direction, and to always keep two metres away from others. The length of an average visit is approximately 2 to 3 hours, during which time it is possible to see a wide range of objects in the collection.</p>
